# Rustic-keyboard-layout
As a very well-balanced allrounder with a fresh approach to vowels / punctuation, this is a high-performing alternative to Gallium and other custom keyboard layouts.

It's named according to the many nature-related terms visible on the vowel hand (e. g. oak, yak and German Kuh, Huf).

Its advantages lie exclusively in the stats of the vowel hand. Here it has a large share of SFBs on the index finger, relieving the ring finger, plus it has a much lower amount of scissoring from having punctuation on index.

Notes on the comparison with Gallium:
- Per-finger SFB on the vowel hand is much better (more on index, less on ring - stats not yet included in the image).
- Hand balance is slightly better for Rustic - almost a perfect 50:50.
- Finger load: while piniky and middle finger load is more or less identical, there is considerably less stress on the right ring finger (pinkies are about the same) plus with Rustic, there is more load on the index fingers
- Period and comma are easier to type on Rustic: right index (rather than right pinky) followed by right thumb; punctuation is well placed on the central index column as the following use of the spacebar affords the hand some time to slide back into the home position.
- Per-finger SFB: Rust's higher overall SFB stat is mostly covered by the index fingers, relieving the right ring finger in particular, though right pinky SFB is slightly higher on Rustic.
- Rustic beats most other layouts on scissoring and related stats by shifting punctuation onto the index fingers.
